Random User Generator Project
This project is a small web application that accesses and displays user data from the Random User Generator API. It demonstrates my ability to work with APIs, design a simple user interface, and implement various functionalities. The main goal of this project is to create a page that displays multiple user cards similar to what can be found on Random User Generator.

Features
Display User Cards: The application fetches user data from the Random User Generator API and displays multiple user cards on the same page.

Add Users: Clicking a button adds 10 new user cards to the existing list of users.

Delete User: You can remove a specific user card by clicking on a delete button associated with each card.

Gender Filter: You can filter the displayed users by gender using a filter.

Sort by Date of Birth: Users can be sorted by their date of birth in ascending or descending order.

Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
Random User Generator API

Additional Notes
The design of the user cards and overall styling can be further improved. This project focuses more on functionality and less on design.
This project was designed to be completed in a few hours, and it may not be perfect or fully polished.
